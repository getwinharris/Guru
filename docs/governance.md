# Guru Ecosystem: Final Governance & Guardrails

## 1. Data Ownership & Retention Rules
- **Dialogue Persistency**: All User and Speaker dialogue is stored in encrypted Firestore threads (WhatsApp-style continuity).
- **Thinker Notes**: Stored per-session. Visible only to the AI and the User. Retained for 90 days to inform long-term mentorship.
- **Scratchpad Logic**: Raw multi-pass reasoning is purged immediately after the "Speaker" generates the response to optimize database weight and user privacy.
- **User Right to Purge**: Users can trigger a "Clean Slate" event, which archives their current "Recall Patch" and starts a fresh JSON thread while preserving earned Certificates.

## 2. Failure & Uncertainty Handling
- **Contradiction Policy**: If Thinker sources conflict, Guru MUST present the debate. 
  - *Format*: "Primary documentation (Source A) states X, while community research (Source B) suggests Y. I recommend testing Z."
- **Low-Quality Warning**: If search results are sparse or high-noise, Guru displays a "Limited Grounding" badge and fallbacks to the "Fundamental Principles" (internal knowledge) while advising the user to upload local documents.
- **Tool Failure**: If a Workspace API (Calendar/Drive) fails, Guru continues the lesson but adds a "Sync Pending" task to the user's local dashboard.

## 3. Certification & Proof-of-Work
- **Issuance Logic**: Certificates are not "completion-based" but "proof-based."
- **Criteria**: 
  1. Completion of all "Course Modules."
  2. Successful deployment of a "Project Patch" (verified via GitHub link or internal Code Lab).
  3. A "Deep Recall" quiz passed with >85% accuracy.
- **Identity**: Certificates are stored as persistent Artifacts in the User's Profile, signed with the Guru's Virtual Identity Hash.

## 4. Community Governance & Safety
- **AI Guardianship**: The Guru node monitors all Community Threads. 
- **Moderation**: It automatically hides toxic or spam content and replies with a private "Mentorship Adjustment" note to the offender.
- **Collaboration**: When two users link a referral project, the Guru merges their "Thinker Notes" into a "Shared Grounding" doc to facilitate joint research.

## 5. Continuity & Snapshot Control
- **Knowledge Snapshots**: Users can "Pin" a Guru version to a specific technology release (e.g., "Always mentor me on React 18, regardless of new updates").
- **Reproducibility**: Project code generated by Guru includes a `grounding_manifest.json` that lists the 50+ sources used for that specific logic.
